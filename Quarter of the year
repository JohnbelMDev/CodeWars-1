Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.

For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.

Test.describe("Basic Tests", () =>{
  Test.assertEquals(quarterOf(3), 1)

const quarterOf = (month) => {
  return month < 4 ? 1 : month < 7 ? 2 : month < 10 ? 3 : 4;
